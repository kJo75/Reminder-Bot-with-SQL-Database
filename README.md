# Reminder-Bot-with-SQL-Database

Using the preinstalled sqlite3 library in python we can create a database and query information into tables. After reading a command with a time and reminder, the bot states the time and reminder in a table and creates a timer in seconds based on the time sent after the command. To send a command, format it as %reminderset # hours # minutes - reminder.
